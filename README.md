SenchaCouch
===========

SenchaCouch is a small library for ExtJS and Sencha Touch for performing CRUD operations and writing nested data sets to
a CouchDB compatible database.

CouchDB Compatible databases(that i know of):

- CouchDB (duh)
- Cloudant
- PouchDB
- Couchbase Lite

**NOTE**: SenchaCouch has been tested with Ext JS 4.2.2 and Sencha Touch 2.3.1

Running The Specs
-----------------
Intructions coming soon...
I use pouchdb and pouchdb-server on node.js

License
-------

Need to figure this out, it's probably going to be GPL'd if you're using GPL versions of Sench Touch
or ExtJS otherwise MIT or Apache except for the code taken directly from the Sencha sources

TODO
----

Add more exhaustive test suite.

Seperate nested data code and CouchDB specific code so this can be applied to MongoDB etc.
